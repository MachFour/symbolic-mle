### Symbolic data tests

This code implements 4 test cases of fitting univariate parametric distributions
to distribution-valued symbolic data.

The test cases are:
1. Fitting a uniform distribution to normal distribution-valued symbols
2. Fitting a uniform distribution to uniform distribution-valued symbols
3. Fitting a normal distribution to uniform distribution-valued symbols
4. Fitting a normal distribution to normal distribution-valued symbols


# Required software

The following software is sufficient to run this code.
Lower (or higher) versions may also work but are untested.

* Python 3.10
* NumPy 1.22.3
* SciPy 1.8.0
* Matplotlib 3.5.1

# Running

1. Open the main.py script and uncomment the test case of interest
2. Run the main.py using Python
