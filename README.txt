### Symbolic data tests

This code implements 4 test cases of fitting univariate parametric distributions
to distribution-valued symbolic data.

The test cases are:
1. Fitting a uniform distribution to normal distribution-valued symbols
2. Fitting a uniform distribution to uniform distribution-valued symbols
3. Fitting a normal distribution to uniform distribution-valued symbols
4. Fitting a normal distribution to normal distribution-valued symbols
